# Android Donations Lib

Android Donations Lib supports donations by Google Play Store, Flattr, PayPal, and Bitcoin.

It is used in projects, such as OpenKeychain, AdAway, FasterGPS, and NTPSync.

**NOTE: Google mailed me to remove PayPal donation capability when publishing on Google Play! Thus, you should build "product flavors" defined by the example: One version with Google Play donation capability and one with Paypal, Flattr, and Bitcoin!**

## How to import

Add this to your build.gradle:

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.sufficientlysecure:donations:2.5'
}
```

## Translations

Help translating on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/privacyapps/donations/dashboard/).

## Build Example App with Gradle

1. Have Android SDK "tools", "platform-tools", and "build-tools" directories in your PATH (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
2. Export ANDROID_HOME pointing to your Android SDK
3. Download Android Support Repository, and Google Repository using Android SDK Manager
4. Execute ``./gradlew build``

## Add the lib to your project

* The ExampleApp depends on "libraries/Donations" and has two product flavors defined in its gradle configuration.
* See [ExampleApp/build.gradle](https://github.com/sufficientlysecure/donations/blob/master/example/build.gradle) how to build different product flavors. The build script adds ``DONATIONS_GOOGLE`` to the auto generated BuildConfig.java.
* See [DonationsActivity.java](https://github.com/sufficientlysecure/donations/blob/master/example/src/main/java/org/sufficientlysecure/donations/example/DonationsActivity.java) how to instantiate the Fragment based on ``DONATIONS_GOOGLE``.
* When publishing the app you must create managed in-app products for your app in the Google Play Store that matches the ones you defined in ``private static final String[] GOOGLE_CATALOG``
* Add ``<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`` to product flavors that use Flattr
* Add ``<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />`` to product flavors that use Google Play In-app billing
